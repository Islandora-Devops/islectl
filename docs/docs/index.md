# islectl CLI

Command line utility to interact with your local and remote ISLE installs.

## Scope

`islectl` is designed to work with the latest version of ISLE installations using [isle-site-template](https://github.com/islandora-devops/isle-site-template). If you don't deviate too far, or better yet only use commands provided by `islectl` to modify your site template, `islectl` will be a handy tool to aid in your repository platform management.

## Features

`islectl` provides many commands that all work the same whether you're running `islectl` from your laptop to interact with your local development environment, or if you're accessing a remote server that is running ISLE.

## Learn more

You can learn more about installing `islectl` and the commands the tool provides in the [Getting started](./install/) and [Commands](./commands/) sections.
